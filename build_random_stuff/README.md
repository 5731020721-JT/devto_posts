After listening to a few React Podcast episodes (it's awesome)
Two things resonated with me very strongly:
"Learn in Public" and "Build dumb s\*\*\*"
(episodes 36 and 42 respectively)

thanks to Shawn Swyx Wang and Sara Vieira

so basically combining these:

Build dumb s\*\*\* publicly

i also find that i get over the initial slump if i just start doing something.
planning and organizing is definitely important to do a meanigful project,
but I feel that i will only get there if I have something first, to start the cycle

do something small -> get inspired/confident -> desire to do more

(also from a book)

so here's to starting small with something dumb, since it is the journey after all, not the destination :)

===
if you find it really dumb, useless and random then, i'm happy since i still got my fix to code,
if you find it at the very least nice, useful and mind-blowing then i'm happy too
